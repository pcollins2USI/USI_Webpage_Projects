	<h3>Organizing the grocery list</h3>
	<p>
		Make a list of the items you purchase regularly and include the name of the grocery store.  Leave space for additional items you may want to add later.  Photocopy the list and keep it handy somewhere in the kitchen, possibly on the refrigerator.
	</p>
	<p>
		Check off the items you need when you run out.  When it is time to go shopping, your list is practically done!!	Plus, the items that are not marked, are reminders of things you may not have realized you needed.
	</p>
	<h3>Cost Cutting Strategy</h3>
	<p>
		Keep a list of the foods and other items you buy regularly and make a note of the price you  pay and the price you see in ads or in other stores.  You will really see if you are paying a good price or when how much you actually save when stores have sales.

	<h3>Food tips</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li>Cracked Eggs</li>
		<dl>
			<dd>If your egg cracks during boiling, add a splash of vinegar to the water to seal the crack and save the egg.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<li>Fresh Eggs</li>
		<dl>
			<dd>You can figure out how fresh your eggs are by placing it in a bowl in culd water.  if it lies on its side, it is fresh.  If it stands at an angle, it is at least 3 days old.  If it stands on end, it's at least 10 days old.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<li>Toss the salad
		</li>
		<dl>
			<dd>Leftover tossed salad won't last very long unless you place several sheets of paper towels in the bottom of the plastic bag or container you will store the lettuce in.  It soaks up the excess moisture and keeps the vegetables from getting soggy.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<li>Fork over the spoons</li>
		<dl>
			<dd>That roast will stay juicy if, while you are cooking it, you turn it over with two wooden spoons.  The spoons won't pierce the meat and allow the juices to run out like the fork will.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<li>Honey do's</li>
		<dl>
			<dd>To avoid a sticky mess when measuring honey, spray or wipe the measuring spoon or cup with cooking oil.  The honey will flow right out onto your recipe.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<li>Slide Home on the Plate</li>
		<dl>
			<dd>If you sprinkle a few drops of water on the serving plate when you unmold a congealed dessert or salad, it will be easier to move around and center on the dish.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<li>Oil Changes</li>
		<dl>
			<dd>Olive oil comes in several grades, with extra-virgin being the tastiest but most expensive.  Save money by reserving that for salads and other cold uses.  In cooking, you lose some of the flavor anyway, so you might as well start with a cheaper variety.  You can also save money by making your own nonstick cooking spray.  Just put your olive oil into a spray bottle.
			</dd>
		</dl>
	</ul>

	<h3>Pots and Pan Fixes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Teflon Trickery</li>
			<dl>
			<dd>For stubborn stains in nonstick cookware, boil one-half cup vinegar, one cup water, and two tablespoons of baking powder in the stained pan for 10 minutes.  Rinse and dry.  Before using it again, season the non-stick surface with a coat of cooking oil.
			</dd>
			</dl>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="bob">Ousting Kitchen Odors</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Odor-free Fingers</li>
		<dl>
			<dd>Rub your hands before you start, and again afterwards, with white vinegar.  Also, rubbing them with a stalk of celery works.  To remove the smell of fish, rub them with vinegar and lemon.  If all fails, get out your toothpaste and use it to wash your hands.  The same ingredients that clean and freshen your mouth will do the same for your skin.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<br />
		<li>Pest Proof Your Home</li>
		<dl>
			<dd>To keep ants away, wipe down your countertops, cabinets, and floors with a solution of one part vinegar to one part water.
			</dd>
		<br />
			<dd>Flies are repelled by citrus, so scratch the peel of an orange and leave it out, or hang a bundle of cloves, or keep a pot of fresh mint in the kitchen window.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<br />
		<li>Yucky smells</li>
		<dl>
			<dd>To prevent odors in garbage cans, empty them frequently.  Add a sprinkle of borax in the bottom of the can to prevent growth of odor-producing molds and bacteria.
			</dd>
		<br />
			<dd>Remove food debris, and leave a fresh scent in the garbage disposal.  Put in about a half-dozen ice cubes, run the system, and flush it well with cold water.  Then put in half of a lemon and grind it up.  Or, for a warmer deodorizing, pour in one-half cup of salt, then add hot water and run the disposal.
			</dd>
		</dl>
	</ul>

		<h3 class="new">Kitchen Safety</h3>
	<ul>
		<dl>
		<li>Firestarter</li>
			<dd>If a grease fire is small, it may be quicker to slide a tight-fitting lid carefully over the flame and turn off the heat.  Wait until it is cool to uncover it.  You can also smother a grease fire with baking soda, but never use fire or water.
			</dd>
		<br />
			<dd>If a fire starts in the oven, keep the door closed, and turn the heat off.  The fire should die out on its own.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<li>Appliance Competition</li>
			<dd>If your refrigerator is located right next to your stove or dishwasher, figure out a way to move it.  This arrangement of a "hot" appliance next to a "cold" one makes both of these machines function less efficiently.  By separating your refrigerator, it will last years longer.
			</dd>
