<!-- The css link is commented; therefore, the html is not attached to css. Before fixing, run to see the html sequence rendering a 1-column wireframe.

Uncomment the css link.  Then run html in Chrome and note that css has been used to render a 2-column wireframe.

Resize browser window to a small window.  Why do some things overlap?

Run in Firefox and IE.
Add  display: block;  for HTML5 elements to correct IE (and older browsers) rendering   (SEE css)

IF I wanted to begin "Locally Roasted Free-Trade Coffee" below the image that has been floated to the right, apply a clear:right to that h2 element.... -->
