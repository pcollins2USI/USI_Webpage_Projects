	<h1>Frequently Asked Tennis Questions</h1>
	<p>What's a foot fault?</p>
	
	<p>A foot fault is called if the server's foot enters the court before service is completed. It is okay, however, to cross the baseline as long as you hit the ball before your feet hit the ground.	</p>

	<p>What's a double fault?	</p>
	
	<p> During a service situation, the server has two chances to strike the ball into the opponent's service box. If the first ball does not enter the service box (including being hit into the server's own net), then a fault results. After one fault a server may serve again. If both tries result in faults, a double fault is called, and the opponent wins the point.	</p>
	
	<p>What if it's not my fault? I was losing a point but before it was official, a ball from the adjacent court rolled on to my court. I called a let immediately but my opponent thought I called it because I was about to lose the point. Was I wrong?	</p>
	
	<p> Balls from the adjacent court that interfere with your play should be called as a let right away.	</p>
	
	<p>As a server, am I obligated to call my own service balls out? 	</p>
	
	<p>When serving, you should not call your first ball out even if you suspect it is. The opponent has a better view of the ball than you and it is the opposing side's call. Second serves, however, should be called out by you when warranted.	</p>
