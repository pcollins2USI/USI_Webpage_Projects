		<h1>The History of Tennis</h1>
</header>
<main>
		<p>The game of tennis is believed to have been created by Walter Clopton Wingfield and was originally referred to as lawn tennis. The game is believed to have been modeled either on an ancient Greek game, or more likely, after squash and badminton. The first game was played in Bermuda in 1873. Mary Ewing Outerbridge brought the game to the United States the next year. It was played at the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club in 1874.

		<h3>Championship Beginnings</h3>
		<p>The All-England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, England held the first world amateur championships for men in 1877. The women's championships were held in 1884. In 1881 the United States Lawn and Tennis Association was created in 1881. This organization created standardized rules and equipment specifications.
