	<h2>The Court</h2>
	<p>A regulation tennis court is 78 feet long. When playing singles the court is 27 feet wide. When playing doubles the court becomes 36 feet wide with the addition of the alleys. A three foot high net (at the center) divides the court into two equal sides.White lines are used to mark the court. Courts are made up of grass, clay, asphalt, concrete or other material.
	</p>
	<h2>The Tennis Ball</h2>
	<p>The tennis ball is between 2 and 1/2 and 2 5/8 inched in diameter. A standard ball weighs just over 2 ounces. While most balls are yellow or white, other colors are available.
	</p>
	<h2>The Racket</h2>
	<p>The very first tennis rackets were made of wood. Most rackets today are made of aluminum or graphite. These materials are lighter and can increase the power of the player. All sizes and shapes of rackets are now available, but in official play the maximum length of a racket is 32 inches. The maximum width is 12.5 inches and the racket head can not exceed a length of 15.5 inches.
	</p>
	<h2>The Dress</h2>
	<p>Traditionally tennis players wore white clothing including white shoes. Today almost every imaginable color and fashion are seen on the courts.
