	<h1>What's the Score?</h1>

	<h2>How to Receive Individual Points</h2>
	<p>Players receive a point when the other player or side does not hit the ball successfully back to the opposite court.&nbsp; A ball bouncing twice on a court results in a lost point. Points are also lost when a ball is hit into the net or hit outside the boundary lines. When serving, a player gets two opportunites to get the ball into the service court. Failure to do so results in a lost point for the server (called a double fault). Finally, points can be lost when a player fails to return a service ball into the boundary lines.
	</p>
	<h2>Keeping Score</h2>
	<p>A tennis game is won when one player (or side) receives four points and is two points ahead. The first point is referred to as 15, the second is referred to as 30, 40 is the term for the fourth point and game is the winning point. Zero points is designated by the term love. When two sides both have a score of 40, that is referred to as deuce. At a deuce score, the play continues  until one player wins by two points.&nbsp; After deuce, the player leading by a single point has the advantage. If the server is leading, then the score is ad-in. If the receiver is winning, the score is ad-out. It is the servers responsibility to keep the score of their game. The score of the server is always given first.
	</p>
	<h2>Winning Games and Sets</h2>
	<p>When a player or side has won at least six games and is two or more games ahead of their opponents then they have won the set. Tennis matches are usually the best two out of three sets or the best three out of five sets.
