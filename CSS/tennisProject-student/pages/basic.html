		<h1>The Basic Strokes of Tennis</h1>
		<hr />
		<dl>
			<dt>Forehand</dt>
			<dd>In this most common of shots, the player turns the body so that the shoulder of arm not
		    holding the racket faces the net.&nbsp;&nbsp; The player then swings the racket forward to
		    meet the ball and follows through over their shoulder.</dd>
			<dt>Backhand</dt>
			<dd>In the backhand stroke the player turns the other shoulder to the net and swings across
		    the body.</dd>
			<dt>Grips</dt>
			<dd>In a basic grip the player grabs the bottom of the racket in a manner similar to shaking
		    hands.&nbsp; Many players now employ a two-handed grip when hitting a backhand.</dd>
			<dt>Lob</dt>
			<dd>A high, sharpley arced return is called a lob.&nbsp; This shot is frequently employed to
		    force your opponent away from the net.&nbsp; Because of its high trajectory, it can also
		    be used to give a player more time to regain positioning.</dd>
			<dt>Overhead Smash</dt>
			<dd>Frequently a <em>lob</em> shot is returned with an <i>overhead smash</i>.&nbsp; This
		    shot is hit in a manner similar to a serve and is very powerful.</dd>
			<dt>Drop Shot</dt>
			<dd>The <i>drop shot</i> is a lightly hit, spinning return that drops softly over the net,
		    forcing the opponent to approach the net. If the opponent is positioned deep in the court,
		    the drop shot can be used to win the point.</dd>
			<dt>Volley</dt>
			<dd>When playing close to the net, the most common type of stroke is a <em>volley</em>,
		    which is a return of the ball before it bounces.</dd>
			<dt>Half Volley </dt>
			<dd>When a player returns a low ball just as it bounces on the court, that shot is referred
		    to as a half volley.</dd>
