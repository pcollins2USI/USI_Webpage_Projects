		<h3>Master Volleyer</h3>
		<p>Line up at the service “T”, run forward as your friend feeds you a ball, split-step, then volley to each letter’s given area in order: M=left service box, A=right service box, S=left half of singles court beyond the service line, T=right half of singles court beyond the service line, E=left alley (doubles), R=right alley. </p>
		<h3>Alley Rally</h3>
		<p>Stand within the doubles alley and try to hit 10 shots with a partner, all within the alley.
	 	</p>
		<h3>20-ball Suicide</h3>
		<p>Have your friend stand at the center line at the net opposite you to feed you balls while you are at the baseline on the opposite side. Have the friend hit balls in every direction, forcing you to constantly move. For every ball that you retrieve successfully, you get a point. For every ball that you miss or cannot get to, you lose a point. Keep playing until you reach a score of 20.
		</p>
		<h3>Four-ball Drill</h3>
		<p>
		Have your friend hit you a series of four shots over and over in the same order. From the net, have the friend hit the ball so that you have to hit a forehand down the line. The next shot that you have to execute is a backhand down the line. Third, hit a forehand cross court. Finally, hit a backhand cross court. This drill will look like a drawing of the letter “X” sketched over and over again.
