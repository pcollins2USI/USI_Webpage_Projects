		<h1>The History of Tennis</h1>
		<p>The game of tennis is believed to have been created by Walter Clopton Wingfield and was
originally referred to as lawn tennis. The game is believed to have been modeled
either on an ancient Greek game, or more likely, after squash and badminton. The first
game was played in Bermuda in 1873. Mary Ewing Outerbridge brought the game to the United
States the next year. It was played at the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club in
1874.

		<h3>Championship Beginnings</h3>
		<p>The All-England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, England held the first world
amateur championships for men in 1877. The women's championships were held in 1884. In
1881 the United States Lawn and Tennis Association was created in 1881. This organization
created standardized rules and equipment specifications.
