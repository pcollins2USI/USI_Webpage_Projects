		<hr />
		<h3>Maintain Focus</h3>
		<h3>Don't Broadcast Your Weaknesses</h3>
		<p>If you consistently miss a particular shot, don't complain about it while playing.
	 Your opponent may pick up on that weakness and deliver the same shot over and over.
	 	</p>
		<h3>Control Your Breathing</h3>
		<blockquote>
			<ul>
	  			<li>Breathe in through your nose and exhale through your mouth.
	  			</li>
				<li>Time your breathing so that you exhale when connecting with the ball.
				</li>
			</ul> 
		</blockquote>
